# SlightlyLessBasicSentimentAnalysis
 
The objective of this task was to find the most successful app developer from a group of 3 using the reviews of their apps on Amazon. To do this, it was necessary to develop a sentiment analysis algorithm. This was accomplished using the CountVectorizer BoW model to develop the features and these features were fed into multiple ML algorithms and an optimal algorithm was chosen based on accuracy scores (primarily the f-measure). The predicted results of that algorithm were used to select what apps were reviewed with positive sentiment and the positive sentiment apps were sieved through and assigned to their respective developers.
